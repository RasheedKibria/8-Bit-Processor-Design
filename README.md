# 8-Bit-Processor-Design
SAP1 Computer Verilog HDL Code

I am Rasheed Kibria.
I am a graduate from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
I have a great fascination in digital VLSI design and FPGA prototyping.

I have done this project to implement the RTL version of the Simple-As-Possible-1 (SAP1) Computer Architecture.
I have verified the funtionailty of my design in both Testbench simulation and in FPGA hardware.
This project is done in BUET as a part of Microprocessor Theory Course.
It was traditionally done using 74 series ICs and available memory ICs.
I have given the project a form of SoC.
Very much efficient and compact design.

Thank you a lot....
